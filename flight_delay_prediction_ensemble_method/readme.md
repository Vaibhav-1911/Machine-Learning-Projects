## Dataset : flight-data.csv
Includes 10000 rows and 25 columns
The dataset consists of records of various flights including their origin, destination, arrival delay, air time, weather details etc.

## Agenda
We aim to use ensemble technique in order to build models which can predict wheather a flight will be delayed or not.
For this we have used three separate models namely, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and SVM
Additionally, we have also leveraged adaptive boosting in order to understand wheather it improves the performance of our models
