### Dataset : pima_indian_data.csv

## Agenda
- To inspect the data and share our findings
- To create a pipeline for running a Logistic Regression Model
- To Run a logistic Regression Model and predict the "Class" Variable
- To Identify the best Metric suitable for Model Evaluation
- To compare Logitic Regression model results with other models
- To use different regularization strengths and compare the reults

## Findings
- The Logistic Regression model prediction performance was negtively affected by the imbalanced ratio of the column "Class" and gave a recall score of 61%
- After balancing the ration we had a better recall score of 70%
- The results of the Logistic Regression model run with Cross Validation were much better than the regular model but not better than the one with Balanced Classes
