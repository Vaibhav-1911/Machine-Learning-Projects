## Business Problem
#### To understand what factors influence the Insurance charges that people incur. Being able to predict which factors are more powerful determinants of the insurance charges than others and which of these factors people can control in order to have a lesser insurance spends and a better overall lifestyle

## EDA Findings

#### - Most of our data is right skewed when it comes to charges. Mostly people have insurance charges between the 5000 - 25000 dollars range
#### - A person who smokes and has a BMI above 30 tends to have a higher medical cost
#### - Older people who are also smokers, have a higher insurance charge
#### - There is no significant difference between insurance charges between males and females. However, it must be noted that people with 5 children have significantly less insurance charges when compared to people with 0-4 children
#### - People who are obese and also smoke have very expensive insurance charges on an average. Also, smokers in general have higher insurance charges as compared to non-smokers
